Here’s a clear breakdown, no jargon:

---

## **1. “15 units” — Is a *unit* the same as kWh?**

**Yes.**
In Uganda’s electricity tariff system, **1 unit = 1 kWh** (kilowatt-hour).

So when the tariff says:

* **Lifeline: 0–15 units**,
  it means
* **0–15 kWh per month**, **not per day**.

Uganda’s ERA always applies these brackets **per billing cycle (monthly)**.

---

## **2. Is the schedule classified by *day*?**

**No.**
The classification is **by monthly consumption**, not per day.

So your bill uses:

* 0–15 kWh per **month** → lifeline
* 16–80 kWh per **month** → next block
* etc.

Daily usage only matters because it adds up to the monthly total, but the tariff brackets are monthly.

## **3. What is “Single Phase 240 Volts”?**

This describes the **type of connection** to your home or business.

### **Single-phase 240 V means:**

* You receive **one live wire + one neutral**
* Voltage supplied is **240 V**
* Standard for **most homes, shops, small loads**
* Typical appliances: lights, fridge, TV, chargers, kettle.

### **How it differs from three-phase:**

| Type                    | Voltage | Wires              | Who uses it?                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-phase (240V)** | 240V    | 1 live + 1 neutral | Most homes                                            |
| **Three-phase (415V)**  | 415V    | 3 live + neutral   | Factories, welding, big motors, big pumps, apartments |
